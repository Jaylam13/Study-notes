Service management - is defined as a set of specialised organization capabilities for enabling value to customers in the form of services.

Value - the perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something.

Customers - define requirements for services and take responsibility for outcomes.

Users - use services.

Sponsors - authorize the budget for service consumption.

Supplier - external partner who provides services to the organization.

Organization - a group of people that has its own function, responsibilities and authority to achieve specific objectives.


A service is a means of enabling Value co-creation by facilitating desired outcomes for customers without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.

Product - a configuration of resources, created by the organization that will be potentially valuable to customers.

- Service offering - a specific mix of services and products to a specific customer:
  - goods - ownership is transferred to customer
  - Access to resources - Ownership is not transferred to the consumer.  Access is granted/licensed under agreed terms or conditions
  - Service actions - performed by the provider to address a consumer need.  Performed according to agreement with the consumer.
	
Output is a tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity.

Outcome is a results for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs.

Cost - can be removed from the customer (part of value proposition) and can be imposed on the customer (price for the service consumption).

Risk - Uncertainty of outcome.  Can be good (opportunity) or bad (hazard).

Utility - fit for purpose.  functionality ordered by a product or service to meet a particular need.  Essentially 'what the service does' and can be used to determine whether a service is fit for purpose.

Warranty - fir for use. Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements.  How the service performs and used to determine whether a service is fit for use.

	- Guiding principles
      - Recommendations that guide organizations in any circumstances, even for implementing ITIL4
      - Focus on value - everything we do must be either directly or indirectly valuable to your stakeholders
      - Start where you are - reuse existing resources where possible instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again
      - Progress iteratively with feedback - Dont do everything at once, take baby-steps instead of learning by doing with lots of feedback
      - Collaborate and promote visibility - Involve the right people at the right time and gather factual data to make the right decisions.
      - Think and work holistically - Nothing is every alone, think about the effect of your initiative or work on other components.  How components are connected to other components.
      - Keep it simple and practical - Dont over complicate work.  Use the least possible steps.  Outcome based thinking helps.
      - Optimize and automate - maximize the value of human work.  Automate only after optimization. Apply DevOps.
